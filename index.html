    <h1> 
        Hello World!
    </h1>
    <p>
        As cheesy as it is, I think it's a great way to greet anyone interested in my web-development journey.
        My hope is to gain these skills to create a blog in which I can track my growth and achievements as I
        grow as both a sewist and a coder. I'm not wholly unfamiliar with coding (I was originally a comp. sci major),
        but sewing with a machine is relatively new. I'm excited to share the things I learn and have an artifact I can
        look back on later on in the future. This will be like a journal for myself to reminisce on, and hopefully a way
        to foster community with like-minded individuals.
